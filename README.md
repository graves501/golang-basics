# golang scripts / beginner steps

While learning some basic go, this repository serves as a collection of little snippets to help me remember the basics.

Usage: `go run [scriptname.go]`

## Initialize module

Since the scripts are outside of the `$GOPATH` you have to initialize the module.
`go mod init [scriptname.go]` and `go build`
