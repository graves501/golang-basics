# golang scripts / beginner steps

While learning some basic go, this repository serves as a collection of little snippets to help me remember the basics.

Usage: `go run [scriptname.go]`

## Initialize module

Since the scripts are outside of the `$GOPATH` you have to initialize the module.
`go mod init [scriptname.go]` and `go build`

As of 19th of June, 2020 I don't have a desire to continue my journey with golang.
I really dislike the syntax and will proceed have a look into `Rust` instead.
